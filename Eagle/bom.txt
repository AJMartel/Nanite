Notes: 
- This is not an easy soldering project! Recommended order is: 1) Rear side 2) Front side 3) Headears
- The USB micro-b socket is a version that come with two alignment pins. It also works without, but is less mechanically stable.
- The tolerances for mounting of the processor are very tight. Make sure it is aligned properly or you will not be able to install the headers.
